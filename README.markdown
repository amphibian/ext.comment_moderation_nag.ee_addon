**Comment Moderation Nag** is an ExpressionEngine extension which displays a prominent, ubiquitous banner to all control panel users with moderation privileges, reminding them to deal with pending comments. If there are no pending comments, no banner is shown.

Why the need for this extension? Because the *tiny* little "Comments Awaiting Validation" link shown at the bottom of the Site Statistics panel on the CP home page is basically invisible to most users, leaving them with often hundreds of pending spam comments, further decreasing the possibility they will ever approve the few legitimate comments that are likely to be trapped in amongst them.

*Comment Moderation Nag has bene tested with ExpressionEngine 1.6.8.*
